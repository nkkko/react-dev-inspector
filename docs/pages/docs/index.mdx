# Why React Dev Inspector

## The Problems

Hey folks, have you ever run into any of these issues 🤔:

- You've got to fix some bugs in your team's project, but you have no idea where the heck page/component's code is located.
- You're eager to dive into an open-source project that interests you, but it's hard to find where the code for the page/component is implemented.
- You may thinking about a component and want to quickly peek at its code, but don't want to memorize or manually expand those never-ending deep file paths.

That's exactly why react-dev-inspector was created.

## React Dev Inspector

**react-dev-inspector** is the tool for seamlessly code navigation from browser to IDE.

With **just a simple click**, you can jump from a React component on the browser to its source code in your local IDE instantly.
Think of it as a more advanced version of Chrome's Inspector.

It's designed to work in any environment:
- **no browser restrictions**, **no framework limitations**.
- doesn't matter whether your code is running **locally**, **remotely**, or even **in a container**.
- also flexible enough to handle both **development** and **production** build modes.

It's not just built for app, also designed to be **integrated into tools** you developed or ready to develop,
like browser extensions and developer toolkits.


### Quick Look

Just check out this demo below and you'll get it in a snap.

<Image
  className='relative my-2 sm:my-4 lg:my-6 w-full'
  src={previewDemo}
  alt='Preview Demo'
  loading='eager'
/>

### Try It Online

Wanna try out the demo right now? Sure, here is the online demo:

  ![Open in StackBlitz](@components/stack-blitz/open-in-stackblitz.svg)
](https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-x3rkzl?file=package.json,vite.config.ts%3AL17)


<div
  className="
    relative -mx-6 md:-ml-12 md:-mr-8 xl:-mr-12
    my-3 h-[600px] bg-[#0e0c0e] rounded-lg
  "

  <StackBlitz
    project='edit/github-x3rkzl'
    openFile='package.json,vite.config.ts%3AL17'
    view='default'
  />
</div>


## How to Use and Configure

According to the working pipeline [below](#how-it-works), the [**Part.1**](/docs/inspector-component) and [**Part.2**](/docs/integration) are what you need configure to use.

Basically, it's includes:
1. [add the `<Inspector/>` component in your page](/docs/inspector-component)
2. [integrate the middleware in your framework's dev-server](/docs/integration)

Check their documentation link for details.


## How It Works

Here is the working pipeline of `react-dev-inspector`:

<Image
  className='relative my-2 sm:my-4 lg:my-6 bg-white/90 rounded-lg shadow-xl'
  src={workingPipeline}
  alt='Working Pipeline'
  loading='eager'
  data-zoomable
/>

### Inject JSX Source

The compiler's [`plugin`](/docs/compiler-plugin) records source path info into React components during development stage.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  **Note:** Most frameworks offer this feature **_out-of-the-box_**,
  which means you usually don't need to manually configure it additionally.
</Callout>

### Inspector Component

The react-dev-inspector provide a [`<Inspector/>`](/docs/inspector-component) component to reads the source info,
and sends it to the dev-server when you inspect elements on browser.

### Dev Server Middleware

The react-dev-inspector provide some [middlewares](/docs/integration) for dev-server in most frameworks to receives source path info from API,
then call your local IDE/Editor to open the source file.
